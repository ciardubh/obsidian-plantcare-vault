## Care Requirements

### Light
- **Ideal**: Bright indirect light
- **Tolerates**: Medium light
- **Avoid**: Direct sun except morning light
- **Signs of too much light**: Yellowing leaves, brown spots
- **Signs of too little light**: Slow growth, smaller leaves, fewer fenestrations

### Water
- **Frequency**: Every 7-10 days, when top 2 inches of soil are dry
- **Method**: Thoroughly drench until water runs from drainage holes
- **Winter adjustment**: Reduce to every 2-3 weeks
- **Signs of overwatering**: Yellowing leaves, soft stems, root rot
- **Signs of underwatering**: Drooping, curling leaves, brown leaf tips

### Soil
- **Composition**: Well-draining mix with perlite, orchid bark, and coco coir (pH 5.5-7.0)

### Temperature
- **Ideal**: 65-85°F (18-29°C)
- **Minimum**: 55°F (13°C)
- **Avoid**: Cold drafts, sudden temperature changes

### Humidity
- **Ideal**: 60-80%
- **Minimum**: 40%
- **Enhancement methods**: Pebble tray, grouping plants, humidifier

### Fertilizer
- **Growing season**: Balanced liquid fertilizer (NPK 20-20-20) diluted to half strength, every 4 weeks
- **Winter**: No fertilizer needed
- **Signs of over-fertilization**: Leaf burn, crust on soil surface

## Seasonal Care

### Spring
- Resume regular watering schedule
- Begin fertilizing
- Ideal time for repotting
- Clean leaves

### Summer
- May need more frequent watering
- Provide bright indirect light
- Maintain higher humidity
- Monitor for pests

### Fall
- Gradually reduce watering
- Stop fertilizing
- Bring indoors before temperatures drop below 55°F

### Winter
- Reduce watering significantly
- Place in brightest available location
- Keep away from heaters and cold drafts
- Monitor humidity levels

## Growth & Development

### Propagation
- **Methods**: Stem cuttings in water or soil, air layering
- **Best time**: Spring or summer
- **Time to root**: 3-5 weeks in water

### Repotting
- **Frequency**: Every 2-3 years
- **Best time**: Spring
- **Pot size**: Increase by 2 inches in diameter
- **Signs needed**: Roots growing from drainage holes, slowed growth

### Pruning
- **Purpose**: Shape, remove damaged leaves, control size
- **Method**: Cut stems below node with clean, sharp scissors
- **Best time**: Spring or summer

## Common Issues

### Pests
- **Spider mites**: Fine webbing, stippled leaves
- **Mealybugs**: White cotton-like masses
- **Scale**: Brown bumps on stems and leaves

### Diseases
- **Root rot**: Soft, brown roots; yellowing leaves
- **Leaf spot**: Brown spots with yellow halos

### Troubleshooting
- **No fenestrations**: Too little light or immature plant
- **Brown leaf tips**: Low humidity or inconsistent watering
- **Yellowing leaves**: Overwatering or nutrient deficiency
- **Leggy growth**: Reaching for light

## Notes
- Toxic to pets and humans if ingested
- Natural air purifier
- Juvenile leaves start without holes/slits, developing them as the plant matures
- Can grow very large in ideal conditions
