# COFFEE PLANT
![[coffee-plant.jpg]]

## Care Requirements

### Light
- **Ideal**: Bright indirect light
- **Tolerates**: Morning direct sun, partial shade
- **Avoid**: Intense direct sunlight, deep shade
- **Signs of too much light**: Scorched, brown-edged leaves
- **Signs of too little light**: Leggy growth, sparse foliage, reduced berry production

### Water
- **Frequency**: Every 5-7 days, when top 1 inch of soil is dry
- **Method**: Water thoroughly until it drains from bottom
- **Winter adjustment**: Reduce to every 10-14 days
- **Signs of overwatering**: Yellowing leaves, drooping stems, root rot
- **Signs of underwatering**: Wilting, curling leaves, leaf drop

### Soil
- **Composition**: Rich, well-draining potting mix with perlite and organic matter (pH 6.0-6.5)

### Temperature
- **Ideal**: 65-75°F (18-24°C)
- **Minimum**: 55°F (13°C)
- **Avoid**: Temperatures below 50°F (10°C) and above 85°F (29°C)

### Humidity
- **Ideal**: 50-70%
- **Minimum**: 40%
- **Enhancement methods**: Pebble tray, humidifier, grouping plants, misting

### Fertilizer
- **Growing season**: Balanced liquid fertilizer diluted to half strength, every 2-4 weeks
- **Winter**: Reduce to once every 6-8 weeks
- **Signs of over-fertilization**: Leaf burn, salt buildup on soil

## Seasonal Care

### Spring
- Increase watering frequency
- Resume regular fertilizing schedule
- Watch for blossoms (white, jasmine-scented)
- Ideal time for repotting

### Summer
- Maintain consistent moisture
- Provide adequate humidity
- Shield from hot afternoon sun
- Regular fertilizing

### Fall
- Gradually reduce watering frequency
- Reduce fertilizing
- Watch for developing berries if plant flowered
- Bring outdoor plants inside before temperatures drop

### Winter
- Reduce watering significantly
- Minimal fertilizing
- Place in brightest available location
- Keep away from cold drafts and heating vents

## Growth & Development

### Propagation
- **Methods**: Seeds from fresh berries, stem cuttings
- **Best time**: Spring or early summer
- **Time to root**: 3-4 weeks for cuttings, 4-8 weeks for seed germination

### Repotting
- **Frequency**: Every 1-2 years for young plants, every 2-3 years for mature plants
- **Best time**: Spring
- **Pot size**: 1-2 inches larger in diameter
- **Signs needed**: Roots circling pot or growing through drainage holes, slowed growth

### Pruning
- **Purpose**: Control height, encourage bushier growth, remove damaged leaves
- **Method**: Trim with clean, sharp scissors
- **Best time**: Early spring, after fruiting

## Common Issues

### Pests
- **Spider mites**: Fine webbing, stippled leaves
- **Mealybugs**: White cotton-like masses
- **Scale**: Brown bumps on stems and leaves
- **Coffee leaf miners**: Tunnels within leaves

### Diseases
- **Root rot**: Yellowing leaves, soft stems, foul smell
- **Leaf rust**: Orange-yellow spots on leaf undersides
- **Bacterial blight**: Water-soaked leaf spots, branch dieback

### Troubleshooting
- **Yellow leaves**: Overwatering, nutrient deficiency, or normal aging
- **Brown leaf edges**: Low humidity, underwatering, or fertilizer burn
- **Leaf drop**: Temperature stress, overwatering, or underwatering
- **No flowers/berries**: Plant too young (typically 3-4 years minimum), insufficient light

## Notes
- Toxic to pets if leaves or berries are ingested in large quantities
- Can produce coffee berries when mature (3+ years old) with proper care
- Berries start green, turn red when ripe, and contain two coffee "beans" (seeds)
- Excellent air-purifying properties
- Glossy, dark green leaves with attractive, compact growth habit
- Can grow 6-8 feet tall indoors with proper care
- Often used as an ornamental houseplant even if not grown for coffee production
- Berries take 9-11 months to ripen after flowering
- White flowers are fragrant, similar to jasmine
- Arabica coffee is considered higher quality than Robusta (Coffea canephora)
