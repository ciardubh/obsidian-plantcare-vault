# SNAKE PLANT
![[snake-plant.jpg]]

## Care Requirements

### Light
- **Ideal**: Medium to bright indirect light
- **Tolerates**: Low light, shade
- **Avoid**: Intense direct sunlight for extended periods
- **Signs of too much light**: Pale, yellowish leaves, brown spots
- **Signs of too little light**: Slow or no growth (plant will survive but not thrive)

### Water
- **Frequency**: Every 2-4 weeks, when soil is completely dry
- **Method**: Water sparingly but thoroughly
- **Winter adjustment**: Reduce to once monthly or less
- **Signs of overwatering**: Soft, mushy leaves, root rot, yellowing
- **Signs of underwatering**: Wrinkled, thin leaves (rare - very drought tolerant)

### Soil
- **Composition**: Fast-draining cactus/succulent mix with extra perlite (pH 5.5-7.0)

### Temperature
- **Ideal**: 60-85°F (15-29°C)
- **Minimum**: 50°F (10°C)
- **Avoid**: Temperatures below 45°F (7°C), cold drafts

### Humidity
- **Ideal**: 30-50%
- **Minimum**: 20%
- **Enhancement methods**: Not necessary (thrives in dry conditions)

### Fertilizer
- **Growing season**: Diluted cactus fertilizer at 1/4 strength, every 2-3 months
- **Winter**: No fertilizer needed
- **Signs of over-fertilization**: Brown leaf tips, white crust on soil

## Seasonal Care

### Spring
- Resume occasional watering
- Apply light fertilizer
- Check for new growth points
- Repot if necessary

### Summer
- Monitor soil dryness (may need slightly more frequent watering)
- Watch for rare blooms (small, fragrant greenish-white flowers)
- Wipe leaves to remove dust

### Fall
- Reduce watering frequency
- Stop fertilizing
- Bring outdoor plants inside before temperatures drop

### Winter
- Minimal watering (once a month or less)
- Keep away from cold drafts and heating vents
- No fertilizer

## Growth & Development

### Propagation
- **Methods**: Division of rhizomes, leaf cuttings
- **Best time**: Spring or summer
- **Time to root**: 4-8 weeks for leaf cuttings, immediate for divisions

### Repotting
- **Frequency**: Every 2-5 years
- **Best time**: Spring
- **Pot size**: Only slightly larger (prefers to be somewhat pot-bound)
- **Signs needed**: Roots breaking pot, extremely crowded, poor drainage

### Pruning
- **Purpose**: Remove damaged leaves
- **Method**: Cut leaves at soil level with clean, sharp knife
- **Best time**: Any time as needed

## Common Issues

### Pests
- **Mealybugs**: White cotton-like masses
- **Spider mites**: Fine webbing, stippled leaves (rare)
- **Scale**: Small brown bumps on leaves

### Diseases
- **Root rot**: Soft, yellow leaves, mushy base
- **Southern blight**: White fungus at soil level
- **Fungal leaf spots**: Brown or black spots on leaves

### Troubleshooting
- **Drooping leaves**: Overwatering
- **Brown spots**: Sunburn or cold damage
- **Yellow leaves**: Overwatering or root problems
- **Curling leaves**: Underwatering (rare)

## Notes
- Toxic to pets and humans if ingested
- One of NASA's top air-purifying plants
- Night oxygen producer
- Very long-lived; can thrive for decades
- Various varieties including 'Laurentii' (yellow edges), 'Moonshine' (silver), 'Cylindrica' (cylindrical)
- Called "Mother-in-Law's Tongue" for the sharp leaf tips
- Recent taxonomic reclassification from Sansevieria to Dracaena genus
