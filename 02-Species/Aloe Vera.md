## Care Requirements

### Light
- **Ideal**: Bright indirect light with some direct morning sun
- **Tolerates**: Partial shade
- **Avoid**: Intense afternoon direct sunlight
- **Signs of too much light**: Leaves turning brown or reddish
- **Signs of too little light**: Elongated, thin leaves, leaning toward light source

### Water
- **Frequency**: Every 2-3 weeks, when soil is completely dry
- **Method**: Thorough soaking until water runs from drainage holes
- **Winter adjustment**: Reduce to once monthly
- **Signs of overwatering**: Soft, mushy leaves, root rot, yellowing
- **Signs of underwatering**: Thin, curled, concave leaves

### Soil
- **Composition**: Fast-draining cactus/succulent soil with added perlite or pumice (pH 6.0-7.0)

### Temperature
- **Ideal**: 60-75°F (15-24°C)
- **Minimum**: 50°F (10°C)
- **Avoid**: Frost and temperatures below 40°F (4°C)

### Humidity
- **Ideal**: 30-40%
- **Minimum**: 10%
- **Enhancement methods**: Not needed (prefers dry conditions)

### Fertilizer
- **Growing season**: Diluted cactus fertilizer at 1/4 strength, every 2-3 months
- **Winter**: No fertilizer needed
- **Signs of over-fertilization**: Leaf burn, white crust on soil

## Seasonal Care

### Spring
- Resume regular watering schedule
- Apply light fertilizer
- Remove any damaged leaves
- Check for and separate offsets (pups)

### Summer
- Protect from intense midday sun
- Increase watering frequency slightly during heat waves
- Monitor for pests

### Fall
- Reduce watering frequency
- Stop fertilizing
- Bring indoors before temperatures drop below 50°F

### Winter
- Minimize watering (once a month)
- Place in brightest available location
- Keep away from cold drafts and heating vents

## Growth & Development

### Propagation
- **Methods**: Division of offsets (pups)
- **Best time**: Spring or early summer
- **Time to root**: 2-4 weeks for offsets to establish

### Repotting
- **Frequency**: Every 2-3 years
- **Best time**: Spring
- **Pot size**: Only slightly larger than previous pot
- **Signs needed**: Pot-bound, offsets filling pot, growth slowing

### Pruning
- **Purpose**: Remove damaged leaves, harvest gel
- **Method**: Cut leaves at base with sharp, clean knife
- **Best time**: Any time for damage, outer leaves for harvest

## Common Issues

### Pests
- **Mealybugs**: Cotton-like white masses
- **Scale insects**: Brown bumps on leaves
- **Spider mites**: Fine webbing, stippled appearance

### Diseases
- **Root rot**: Mushy stems, foul odor, yellowing
- **Leaf rot**: Soft, water-soaked spots
- **Fungal infections**: Black or brown spots on leaves

### Troubleshooting
- **Flopping leaves**: Over-watering or insufficient light
- **No new growth**: Not enough light or nutrients
- **Brown spots**: Sunburn or fungal infection
- **Shriveled leaves**: Under-watering

## Notes
- Medicinal plant with gel used for burns, skin conditions
- Toxic to pets if ingested
- Can flower in ideal conditions (tall spike with tubular yellow or orange flowers)
- Multiple varieties exist with different patterns and sizes
- Most effective at removing formaldehyde from air
