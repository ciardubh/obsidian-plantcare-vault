# CALLA LILY (ZANTEDESCHIA)
![[zantedeschia.jpg]]

## Care Requirements

### Light
- **Ideal**: Bright indirect light with morning sun
- **Tolerates**: Partial shade
- **Avoid**: Hot, intense afternoon sun
- **Signs of too much light**: Scorched leaves, wilting
- **Signs of too little light**: Leggy growth, fewer flowers

### Water
- **Frequency**: Every 5-7 days, keeping soil consistently moist during growing season
- **Method**: Water thoroughly at soil level
- **Winter adjustment**: Reduce significantly during dormancy
- **Signs of overwatering**: Yellowing leaves, soft rhizomes, root rot
- **Signs of underwatering**: Wilting, curling leaves, brown leaf edges

### Soil
- **Composition**: Rich, well-draining potting mix with organic matter (pH 6.0-6.5)

### Temperature
- **Ideal**: 60-75°F (15-24°C)
- **Minimum**: 50°F (10°C)
- **Avoid**: Temperatures below 45°F (7°C) and hot, dry conditions

### Humidity
- **Ideal**: 50-60%
- **Minimum**: 40%
- **Enhancement methods**: Pebble tray, humidifier, grouping plants

### Fertilizer
- **Growing season**: Balanced liquid fertilizer every 2-4 weeks
- **Winter/Dormancy**: No fertilizer needed
- **Signs of over-fertilization**: Leaf burn, excessive foliage with few flowers

## Seasonal Care

### Spring
- Resume regular watering as new growth appears
- Begin fertilizing when leaves emerge
- Repot if necessary
- Perfect time for division

### Summer
- Maintain consistent moisture
- Provide bright light but protect from intense sun
- Deadhead spent flowers
- Continue regular fertilizing

### Fall
- Gradually reduce watering after flowering
- Stop fertilizing
- Prepare for dormancy (for seasonal varieties)

### Winter
- For evergreen varieties: Reduce watering but don't let dry completely
- For seasonal varieties: Allow to go dormant (yellow foliage, minimal watering)
- Keep rhizomes cool (55-60°F) during dormancy
- Bring indoor container plants to a cool, dry location

## Growth & Development

### Propagation
- **Methods**: Division of rhizomes
- **Best time**: Early spring before new growth or late fall after dormancy
- **Time to root**: 2-4 weeks for divisions to establish

### Repotting
- **Frequency**: Every 2 years or when crowded
- **Best time**: Early spring before new growth
- **Pot size**: 1-2 inches larger in diameter
- **Signs needed**: Crowded pot, reduced flowering, poor growth

### Pruning
- **Purpose**: Remove spent flowers, yellowing leaves
- **Method**: Cut at base with clean scissors
- **Best time**: Deadhead flowers as they fade, remove yellowing leaves anytime

## Common Issues

### Pests
- **Aphids**: Small insects on new growth and flower buds
- **Spider mites**: Fine webbing, stippled leaves
- **Thrips**: Silvery streaks on leaves, distorted growth

### Diseases
- **Root rot**: Soft, discolored rhizomes; yellowing leaves
- **Bacterial soft rot**: Foul-smelling, mushy rhizomes
- **Powdery mildew**: White powdery coating on leaves

### Troubleshooting
- **Few or no flowers**: Insufficient light, improper dormancy, or overcrowded rhizomes
- **Yellowing leaves**: Natural during dormancy, otherwise overwatering
- **Leaf spots**: Fungal infection or sunburn
- **Stunted growth**: Poor soil, insufficient nutrients

## Notes
- Toxic to humans and pets if ingested
- Not true lilies but members of the Araceae family
- Available in multiple colors: white, yellow, pink, purple, red, orange
- May be grown as houseplants or in garden beds
- Common varieties include Z. aethiopica (white), Z. rehmannii (pink), and Z. elliottiana (yellow)
- The colorful "flower" is actually a modified leaf called a spathe
- Can be grown as perennials in zones 8-10, as annuals or potted plants in colder zones
- Often associated with weddings and special occasions
- Some varieties are evergreen while others have a distinct dormancy period
