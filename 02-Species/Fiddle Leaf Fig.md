## Care Requirements

### Light
- **Ideal**: Bright indirect light, some morning direct sun
- **Tolerates**: Medium light
- **Avoid**: Direct afternoon sun, low light areas
- **Signs of too much light**: Scorched, bleached leaves
- **Signs of too little light**: Leggy growth, leaf drop, small new leaves

### Water
- **Frequency**: Every 7-10 days, when top 2 inches of soil are dry
- **Method**: Water thoroughly until it drains from bottom
- **Winter adjustment**: Reduce to every 2-3 weeks
- **Signs of overwatering**: Brown spots in middle of leaves, leaf drop, root rot
- **Signs of underwatering**: Drooping, curling leaves, brown edges

### Soil
- **Composition**: Well-draining potting mix with perlite and bark (pH 6.0-7.0)

### Temperature
- **Ideal**: 65-85°F (18-29°C)
- **Minimum**: 55°F (13°C)
- **Avoid**: Temperatures below 50°F (10°C), drafts, sudden temperature changes

### Humidity
- **Ideal**: 40-60%
- **Minimum**: 30%
- **Enhancement methods**: Pebble tray, humidifier, grouping plants

### Fertilizer
- **Growing season**: Balanced liquid fertilizer diluted to half strength, monthly
- **Winter**: No fertilizer needed
- **Signs of over-fertilization**: Leaf burn, brown spots, leaf drop

## Seasonal Care

### Spring
- Resume regular watering schedule
- Begin fertilizing
- Wipe leaves to remove dust
- Ideal time for repotting

### Summer
- Maintain consistent watering
- Monitor for pest activity
- Rotate plant for even growth
- Provide appropriate humidity

### Fall
- Gradually reduce watering frequency
- Stop fertilizing
- Prepare for slower winter growth

### Winter
- Reduce watering significantly
- Place in brightest available location
- Keep away from cold drafts and heating vents
- No fertilizer

## Growth & Development

### Propagation
- **Methods**: Stem cuttings in water or soil, air layering
- **Best time**: Spring or early summer
- **Time to root**: 4-8 weeks for stem cuttings

### Repotting
- **Frequency**: Every 1-2 years for young plants, every 2-3 years for mature plants
- **Best time**: Spring
- **Pot size**: Only 1-2 inches larger in diameter
- **Signs needed**: Roots circling pot or growing through drainage holes, slow growth

### Pruning
- **Purpose**: Control height, encourage branching, remove damaged leaves
- **Method**: Use clean, sharp pruners, make cuts just above a node
- **Best time**: Spring or early summer

## Common Issues

### Pests
- **Spider mites**: Fine webbing, stippled leaves
- **Scale insects**: Brown bumps on stems and leaves
- **Mealybugs**: White cotton-like masses

### Diseases
- **Root rot**: Yellow or brown leaves, soft stems
- **Leaf spot**: Brown or black spots on leaves
- **Bacterial infection**: Water-soaked spots, foul smell

### Troubleshooting
- **Brown spots in leaf center**: Overwatering
- **Brown edges on leaves**: Underwatering, low humidity
- **Leaf drop**: Changes in environment, watering issues, shock
- **No new growth**: Insufficient light, root-bound, dormancy period

## Notes
