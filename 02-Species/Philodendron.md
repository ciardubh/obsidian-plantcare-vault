## Care Requirements

### Light
- **Ideal**: Medium to bright indirect light
- **Tolerates**: Low light (but with slower growth)
- **Avoid**: Direct sunlight
- **Signs of too much light**: Yellowing, scorched leaves
- **Signs of too little light**: Leggy growth, smaller leaves, slow growth

### Water
- **Frequency**: Every 7-10 days, when top 1-2 inches of soil are dry
- **Method**: Water thoroughly until it drains from bottom
- **Winter adjustment**: Reduce to every 2-3 weeks
- **Signs of overwatering**: Yellowing leaves, soft stems, root rot
- **Signs of underwatering**: Drooping, curling leaves, brown edges

### Soil
- **Composition**: Well-draining potting mix with perlite or bark (pH 5.5-6.5)

### Temperature
- **Ideal**: 65-85°F (18-29°C)
- **Minimum**: 55°F (13°C)
- **Avoid**: Temperatures below 50°F (10°C) and cold drafts

### Humidity
- **Ideal**: 40-60%
- **Minimum**: 30%
- **Enhancement methods**: Pebble tray, humidifier, grouping plants

### Fertilizer
- **Growing season**: Balanced liquid fertilizer at half strength, monthly
- **Winter**: No fertilizer needed
- **Signs of over-fertilization**: Brown leaf tips, salt buildup on soil

## Seasonal Care

### Spring
- Resume regular watering schedule
- Begin fertilizing
- Repot if necessary
- Ideal time for propagation

### Summer
- Monitor soil moisture more frequently
- Maintain appropriate humidity
- Shield from intense direct sun
- Watch for pest activity

### Fall
- Gradually reduce watering frequency
- Stop fertilizing
- Clean dust from leaves

### Winter
- Reduce watering significantly
- Place in brightest available location
- Keep away from cold drafts and heating vents
- No fertilizer

## Growth & Development

### Propagation
- **Methods**: Stem cuttings in water or soil, air layering for larger plants
- **Best time**: Spring or summer
- **Time to root**: 2-4 weeks for stem cuttings

### Repotting
- **Frequency**: Every 1-2 years
- **Best time**: Spring
- **Pot size**: 1-2 inches larger in diameter
- **Signs needed**: Roots circling pot or growing through drainage holes, slowed growth

### Pruning
- **Purpose**: Control size, encourage bushier growth, remove damaged leaves
- **Method**: Cut stems with clean, sharp scissors
- **Best time**: Spring or summer

## Common Issues

### Pests
- **Spider mites**: Fine webbing, stippled leaves
- **Mealybugs**: White cotton-like masses
- **Scale**: Brown bumps on stems and leaves
- **Aphids**: Small insects on new growth

### Diseases
- **Root rot**: Yellowing leaves, soft stems, foul smell
- **Leaf spot**: Brown spots with yellow halos
- **Bacterial blight**: Water-soaked spots, rapid decline

### Troubleshooting
- **Yellow leaves**: Overwatering, natural aging of lower leaves
- **Brown leaf tips**: Low humidity, underwatering, or mineral buildup
- **Leggy growth**: Insufficient light
- **No new growth**: Dormancy, root-bound, or insufficient light

## Notes
- Toxic to pets and humans if ingested
- Over 450 species with various growth habits (climbing, trailing, upright)
- Air-purifying capabilities
- Popular varieties include:
  - Heartleaf Philodendron (P. hederaceum) - trailing vine with heart-shaped leaves
  - Brasil Philodendron - variegated version of heartleaf with yellow striping
  - Birkin - upright growth with white pinstripe variegation
  - Pink Princess - dark leaves with pink variegation
  - Moonlight - chartreuse young leaves
  - Xanadu - upright with deeply lobed leaves
- Many climbing varieties develop larger leaves when allowed to climb
- Some varieties change leaf shape drastically as they mature
- One of the easiest and most forgiving houseplants
- Named from Greek words "philo" (love) and "dendron" (tree)
