## Care Requirements

### Light
- **Ideal**: Bright indirect light
- **Tolerates**: Medium light, morning sun
- **Avoid**: Direct sunlight, especially afternoon sun
- **Signs of too much light**: Pale, yellowing fronds, brown spots
- **Signs of too little light**: Sparse growth, small fronds, stretching

### Water
- **Frequency**: Every 3-7 days, keeping soil consistently moist
- **Method**: Water thoroughly when top inch of soil feels dry
- **Winter adjustment**: Reduce slightly, but don't allow to dry out completely
- **Signs of overwatering**: Yellowing fronds, soft brown spots, root rot
- **Signs of underwatering**: Drooping, crispy brown fronds, leaf drop

### Soil
- **Composition**: Rich, well-draining potting mix with peat moss and perlite (pH 5.0-5.5)

### Temperature
- **Ideal**: 60-75°F (16-24°C)
- **Minimum**: 50°F (10°C)
- **Avoid**: Temperatures below 45°F (7°C) and above 95°F (35°C)

### Humidity
- **Ideal**: 50-80%
- **Minimum**: 40%
- **Enhancement methods**: Pebble tray, humidifier, misting, bathroom placement

### Fertilizer
- **Growing season**: Balanced liquid fertilizer at half strength, monthly
- **Winter**: No fertilizer needed
- **Signs of over-fertilization**: Brown leaf tips, salt buildup on soil

## Seasonal Care

### Spring
- Resume regular watering and feeding
- Remove any winter-damaged fronds
- Repot if necessary
- Check for pests

### Summer
- Increase watering frequency
- Maintain high humidity
- Shield from direct sun and heat
- Monitor for pests

### Fall
- Gradually reduce watering frequency
- Stop fertilizing
- Begin preparing for winter dormancy

### Winter
- Reduce watering (but keep soil from drying completely)
- Increase humidity as heating systems dry air
- Keep away from radiators and heat vents
- No fertilizer

## Growth & Development

### Propagation
- **Methods**: Division of plant when repotting, rooting runners
- **Best time**: Spring
- **Time to root**: 2-4 weeks

### Repotting
- **Frequency**: Every 1-2 years
- **Best time**: Spring
- **Pot size**: Only 1-2 inches larger in diameter
- **Signs needed**: Roots growing out of drainage holes, water runs straight through pot

### Pruning
- **Purpose**: Remove damaged or brown fronds
- **Method**: Cut at base with clean scissors
- **Best time**: Any time as needed, major pruning in spring

## Common Issues

### Pests
- **Spider mites**: Fine webbing, stippled fronds
- **Mealybugs**: White cotton-like masses
- **Scale**: Brown bumps on stems and fronds

### Diseases
- **Root rot**: Yellowing fronds, soft stems
- **Leaf spot**: Brown spots with yellow halos
- **Southern blight**: White fungal growth at base

### Troubleshooting
- **Brown leaf tips**: Low humidity, underwatering, or excess minerals in water
- **Yellowing fronds**: Overwatering or exposure to direct sunlight
- **Dropping fronds**: Environmental shock, major temperature changes
- **Pale fronds**: Too much light or nutrient deficiency

## Notes
- Non-toxic to pets and humans
- Excellent air purifier - removes formaldehyde and xylene
- Can be grown outdoors in shade in zones 9-11
- Very popular Victorian-era houseplant
- Many cultivars available with different frond shapes and sizes
- 'Fluffy Ruffles', 'Dallas', and 'Roosevelt' are popular varieties
- Provides excellent humidity for other nearby plants
- Can be grown as a hanging plant or on a plant stand
- May drop some fronds when moved to a new location (will adjust)
- Benefits from occasional showering to remove dust and increase humidity
- Prehistoric plant that has remained largely unchanged for millions of years
