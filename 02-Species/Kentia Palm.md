## Care Requirements

### Light
- **Ideal**: Bright indirect light 
- **Tolerates**: Low light, fluorescent lighting
- **Avoid**: Direct sunlight, especially in afternoon
- **Signs of too much light**: Yellowing or scorched fronds
- **Signs of too little light**: Slow growth, thin stems, smaller fronds

### Water
- **Frequency**: Every 7-14 days, when top 1-2 inches of soil are dry
- **Method**: Water thoroughly until it drains from bottom
- **Winter adjustment**: Reduce to every 2-3 weeks
- **Signs of overwatering**: Yellowing fronds, soft stems, root rot
- **Signs of underwatering**: Brown leaf tips and edges, wilting

### Soil
- **Composition**: Well-draining potting mix with perlite and sand (pH 6.0-7.0)

### Temperature
- **Ideal**: 65-85°F (18-29°C)
- **Minimum**: 55°F (13°C)
- **Avoid**: Temperatures below 50°F (10°C) and cold drafts

### Humidity
- **Ideal**: 40-60%
- **Minimum**: 30%
- **Enhancement methods**: Pebble tray, grouping plants, occasional misting

### Fertilizer
- **Growing season**: Balanced liquid palm fertilizer at half strength, every 6-8 weeks
- **Winter**: No fertilizer needed
- **Signs of over-fertilization**: Brown leaf tips, salt buildup on soil

## Seasonal Care

### Spring
- Resume regular watering schedule
- Begin fertilizing
- Clean fronds with damp cloth
- Inspect for pests

### Summer
- Monitor soil moisture more frequently
- Maintain consistent watering schedule
- Provide adequate humidity
- Shield from intense direct sunlight

### Fall
- Gradually reduce watering frequency
- Stop fertilizing
- Reduce humidity measures

### Winter
- Reduce watering significantly
- Place in brightest available location
- Keep away from cold drafts and heating vents
- No fertilizer

## Growth & Development

### Propagation
- **Methods**: Seeds only (difficult for home growers)
- **Best time**: Spring
- **Time to root**: Several months for germination; years for mature plant

### Repotting
- **Frequency**: Every 2-3 years
- **Best time**: Spring or early summer
- **Pot size**: Only 1-2 inches larger in diameter
- **Signs needed**: Roots circling pot or growing through drainage holes, extremely pot-bound

### Pruning
- **Purpose**: Remove dead or damaged fronds
- **Method**: Cut brown fronds at base with clean, sharp scissors
- **Best time**: Any time as needed

## Common Issues

### Pests
- **Spider mites**: Fine webbing, stippled fronds
- **Mealybugs**: White cotton-like masses
- **Scale**: Brown bumps on stems and fronds

### Diseases
- **Root rot**: Yellowing fronds, soft stems
- **Leaf spot**: Brown spots with yellow halos
- **Tip burn**: Brown tips due to dryness or salt buildup

### Troubleshooting
- **Brown leaf tips**: Low humidity, underwatering, or mineral buildup from tap water
- **Yellowing fronds**: Overwatering or nutrient deficiency
- **Drooping fronds**: Underwatering or cold damage
- **Stunted growth**: Poor light, rootbound, or nutrient deficiency

## Notes
- Non-toxic to humans and pets
- Air-purifying capabilities
- Slow-growing and long-lived (can live for decades)
- Excellent for beginner or intermediate plant parents
