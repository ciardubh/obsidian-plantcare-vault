# AFRICAN VIOLET
![[african-violet.jpg]]

## Care Requirements

### Light
- **Ideal**: Bright indirect light, especially from east or north windows
- **Tolerates**: Artificial grow lights (12-14 hours daily)
- **Avoid**: Direct sunlight, deep shade
- **Signs of too much light**: Bleached, burned leaves, tight center growth
- **Signs of too little light**: Leggy growth, few or no flowers, dark green leaves

### Water
- **Frequency**: Every 5-7 days, when soil feels dry to the touch
- **Method**: Bottom water or water at soil level avoiding leaves
- **Winter adjustment**: Reduce slightly, but maintain consistent moisture
- **Signs of overwatering**: Soft, mushy stems, crown rot
- **Signs of underwatering**: Drooping, dry leaves, brown edges

### Soil
- **Composition**: Lightweight, well-draining African violet mix or peat-based mix with perlite (pH 6.0-7.0)

### Temperature
- **Ideal**: 65-75°F (18-24°C)
- **Minimum**: 60°F (15°C)
- **Avoid**: Temperatures below 55°F (13°C) and above 85°F (29°C), drafts

### Humidity
- **Ideal**: 40-60%
- **Minimum**: 30%
- **Enhancement methods**: Pebble tray, humidifier (avoid misting leaves)

### Fertilizer
- **Growing season**: African violet fertilizer (high in phosphorus) at quarter strength, every 2-4 weeks
- **Winter**: Reduce to monthly or less
- **Signs of over-fertilization**: Leaf burn, salt buildup, excessive foliage with few flowers

## Seasonal Care

### Spring
- Resume regular feeding schedule
- Check for increased water needs
- Perfect time for repotting
- Watch for increased flowering

### Summer
- Protect from heat and direct sun
- Maintain consistent watering
- Provide adequate air circulation
- Monitor for pest activity

### Fall
- Gradually reduce fertilizing
- Maintain consistent watering
- Prepare for potential winter dormancy

### Winter
- Reduce fertilizing frequency
- Maintain consistent temperatures
- Provide supplemental lighting if needed
- Protect from cold drafts and heating vents

## Growth & Development

### Propagation
- **Methods**: Leaf cuttings, division of crowns
- **Best time**: Spring or summer
- **Time to root**: 3-4 weeks for leaf cutting roots, 2-3 months for plantlets to appear

### Repotting
- **Frequency**: Every 6-12 months
- **Best time**: Spring
- **Pot size**: African violets prefer to be slightly pot-bound; use small pots (4-5 inches)
- **Signs needed**: Multiple crowns, declining blooms, rootbound

### Pruning
- **Purpose**: Remove spent flowers, damaged leaves, suckers
- **Method**: Pinch or cut at base with clean tools
- **Best time**: As needed throughout the year

## Common Issues

### Pests
- **Cyclamen mites**: Stunted, twisted growth (nearly invisible pests)
- **Thrips**: Streaked or spotted flowers, scarred leaves
- **Mealybugs**: White cotton-like masses

### Diseases
- **Crown rot**: Mushy center, collapsing plant
- **Powdery mildew**: White powdery coating on leaves
- **Botrytis**: Gray fuzzy mold on flowers and leaves

### Troubleshooting
- **No flowers**: Insufficient light, wrong fertilizer, or immature plant
- **Leggy, stretching plants**: Insufficient light
- **Crown rot**: Water on leaves, overwatering
- **Spotty leaves**: Water droplets on leaves causing sunburn

## Notes
- Non-toxic to pets and humans
- Can bloom continuously throughout the year with proper care
- Available in many colors: purple, pink, blue, white, and bi-colors
- Various petal forms: single, double, fringed, ruffled, star-shaped
- Miniature and trailing varieties available
- Prefers shallow pots rather than deep ones
- Water should be room temperature, never cold
- Avoid wetting the leaves as this can cause spotting
- Use water low in minerals (distilled or rainwater ideal)
- Leaves form a symmetrical rosette pattern
- One of the most popular flowering houseplants
- Discovered in 1892 by Baron Walter von Saint Paul-Illaire
- Over 16,000 named varieties exist
