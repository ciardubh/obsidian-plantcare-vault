# SPIDER PLANT
![[spider-plant.jpg]]

## Care Requirements

### Light
- **Ideal**: Bright indirect light
- **Tolerates**: Low light, partial shade
- **Avoid**: Direct sunlight for extended periods
- **Signs of too much light**: Bleached, brown leaves
- **Signs of too little light**: Slower growth, fewer plantlets, less variegation

### Water
- **Frequency**: Every 7-10 days, when top inch of soil is dry
- **Method**: Thorough watering until it drains from bottom
- **Winter adjustment**: Reduce to every 14 days
- **Signs of overwatering**: Yellow leaves, root rot
- **Signs of underwatering**: Leaf tips browning, curling, paleness

### Soil
- **Composition**: Well-draining potting mix with perlite (pH 6.0-7.2)

### Temperature
- **Ideal**: 65-75°F (18-24°C)
- **Minimum**: 45°F (7°C)
- **Avoid**: Temperatures below 35°F (2°C) and sudden changes

### Humidity
- **Ideal**: 40-60%
- **Minimum**: 30%
- **Enhancement methods**: Not critical (tolerates dry air well)

### Fertilizer
- **Growing season**: Balanced houseplant fertilizer at half strength, every 4-6 weeks
- **Winter**: No fertilizer needed
- **Signs of over-fertilization**: Brown leaf tips, salt build-up on soil

## Seasonal Care

### Spring
- Resume regular watering schedule
- Begin fertilizing
- Repot if needed
- Clean leaves

### Summer
- Increase watering frequency if needed
- Watch for abundant plantlet production
- Monitor for browning tips (often from mineral build-up)
- Excellent time for propagation

### Fall
- Gradually reduce watering
- Stop fertilizing
- Harvest mature plantlets

### Winter
- Reduce watering significantly
- Place in bright location
- Maintain average room temperature
- No fertilizer

## Growth & Development

### Propagation
- **Methods**: Plantlets (spiderettes) that grow on long stems
- **Best time**: Spring or summer
- **Time to root**: 10-14 days in water, 2-3 weeks in soil

### Repotting
- **Frequency**: Every 1-2 years
- **Best time**: Spring
- **Pot size**: Only slightly larger than current pot (likes to be somewhat rootbound)
- **Signs needed**: Roots coming through drainage holes, water running straight through

### Pruning
- **Purpose**: Remove damaged leaves, control size
- **Method**: Cut leaves at base with clean scissors
- **Best time**: Any time as needed

## Common Issues

### Pests
- **Aphids**: Small insects on new growth
- **Mealybugs**: White cotton-like masses
- **Spider mites**: Fine webbing, stippled leaves (rare)

### Diseases
- **Root rot**: Yellow leaves, soft stems
- **Leaf spot**: Brown spots with yellow halos
- **Tip burn**: Brown, crispy leaf tips (often from fluoride or chlorine)

### Troubleshooting
- **Brown leaf tips**: Fluoride in water, low humidity, or mineral build-up
- **Pale leaves**: Too much light or nutrient deficiency
- **No plantlets**: Insufficient light, immature plant
- **Curling leaves**: Underwatering

## Notes
- Non-toxic to humans and pets (safe for cats and dogs)
- Excellent air purifier - removes formaldehyde and xylene
- Long-lived plant (can thrive for decades)
- Self-propagating through plantlets (spiderettes)
- Several varieties available: 'Vittatum' (white stripes), 'Bonnie' (curly leaves), 'Variegatum' (white edges)
- Named for the spider-like plantlets that dangle from stems
