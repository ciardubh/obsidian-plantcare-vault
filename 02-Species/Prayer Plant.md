## Care Requirements

### Light
- **Ideal**: Medium to bright indirect light
- **Tolerates**: Low light
- **Avoid**: Direct sunlight
- **Signs of too much light**: Washed-out leaves, brown spots
- **Signs of too little light**: Reduced leaf movement, less vibrant colors

### Water
- **Frequency**: Every 5-7 days, keeping soil consistently moist but not soggy
- **Method**: Water thoroughly with room temperature water
- **Winter adjustment**: Reduce slightly, but don't allow to dry out completely
- **Signs of overwatering**: Yellowing leaves, fungal issues, root rot
- **Signs of underwatering**: Crispy brown edges, curling leaves

### Soil
- **Composition**: Well-draining, peat-based potting mix with added perlite (pH 5.5-6.5)

### Temperature
- **Ideal**: 65-80°F (18-27°C)
- **Minimum**: 60°F (15°C)
- **Avoid**: Temperatures below 55°F (13°C) and cold drafts

### Humidity
- **Ideal**: 60-80%
- **Minimum**: 50%
- **Enhancement methods**: Pebble tray, humidifier, grouping plants, bathroom placement

### Fertilizer
- **Growing season**: Balanced liquid fertilizer at half strength, monthly
- **Winter**: No fertilizer needed
- **Signs of over-fertilization**: Brown leaf tips, burned edges

## Seasonal Care

### Spring
- Resume regular watering schedule
- Begin fertilizing
- Repot if necessary
- Watch for new growth

### Summer
- Maintain consistent moisture
- Increase humidity if needed
- Shield from direct sunlight
- Monitor for pest activity

### Fall
- Gradually reduce watering frequency
- Stop fertilizing
- Begin preparing for slower winter growth

### Winter
- Reduce watering slightly
- Increase humidity as heating systems dry air
- Place in bright location but away from drafts
- No fertilizer

## Growth & Development

### Propagation
- **Methods**: Division of plant during repotting, stem cuttings in water
- **Best time**: Spring or early summer
- **Time to root**: 2-4 weeks for cuttings

### Repotting
- **Frequency**: Every 1-2 years
- **Best time**: Spring
- **Pot size**: Only slightly larger than current pot
- **Signs needed**: Roots growing through drainage holes, crowded appearance

### Pruning
- **Purpose**: Remove damaged leaves, control size, encourage fullness
- **Method**: Cut stems at base with clean scissors
- **Best time**: Spring or early summer

## Common Issues

### Pests
- **Spider mites**: Fine webbing, stippled leaves
- **Mealybugs**: White cotton-like masses
- **Aphids**: Small insects on new growth

### Diseases
- **Root rot**: Yellowing leaves, soft stems
- **Leaf spot**: Brown spots with yellow halos
- **Powdery mildew**: White powdery coating on leaves

### Troubleshooting
- **Brown leaf tips**: Low humidity, mineral buildup from tap water
- **Curling leaves**: Underwatering or low humidity
- **Fading patterns**: Too much direct light
- **Reduced leaf movement**: Low light, stress, or age

## Notes
- Non-toxic to pets and humans
- Famous for its nyctinastic movements - leaves fold up at night like hands in prayer
- Several popular varieties with different leaf patterns:
  - 'Kerchoveana' (Rabbit's Foot) - green with dark spots
  - 'Erythroneura' (Red-veined) - prominent red veins
  - 'Marisela' (Black Prayer Plant) - dark leaves with silver markings
- Closely related to Calathea but generally easier to care for
- Grows relatively low and bushy, ideal for tabletops
- May produce small white flowers in optimal conditions
- Leaves have a distinctive herringbone pattern
- Use filtered or distilled water to avoid leaf spotting
- Sensitive to chlorine and fluoride in tap water
