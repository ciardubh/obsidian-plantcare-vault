![[chinese-money-plant.jpg]]

## Care Requirements

### Light
- **Ideal**: Bright indirect light
- **Tolerates**: Medium light, gentle morning sun
- **Avoid**: Direct sunlight, deep shade
- **Signs of too much light**: Bleached or burned leaves
- **Signs of too little light**: Leggy growth, small leaves, reaching toward light

### Water
- **Frequency**: Every 7-10 days, when top inch of soil is dry
- **Method**: Water thoroughly until it drains from bottom
- **Winter adjustment**: Reduce to every 10-14 days
- **Signs of overwatering**: Yellowing leaves, soft stems, root rot
- **Signs of underwatering**: Drooping, wrinkled leaves

### Soil
- **Composition**: Well-draining potting mix with perlite or pumice (pH 6.0-7.0)

### Temperature
- **Ideal**: 65-75°F (18-24°C)
- **Minimum**: 55°F (13°C)
- **Avoid**: Temperatures below 50°F (10°C) and cold drafts

### Humidity
- **Ideal**: 40-50%
- **Minimum**: 30%
- **Enhancement methods**: Pebble tray, grouping plants (but tolerates average home humidity)

### Fertilizer
- **Growing season**: Balanced liquid fertilizer at half strength, every 2-4 weeks
- **Winter**: No fertilizer needed
- **Signs of over-fertilization**: Brown leaf edges, stunted growth

## Seasonal Care

### Spring
- Resume regular watering schedule
- Begin fertilizing
- Repot if necessary
- Harvest offsets for propagation

### Summer
- Maintain consistent watering
- Rotate plant for even growth
- Shield from intense afternoon sun
- Watch for abundant pup production

### Fall
- Gradually reduce watering frequency
- Stop fertilizing
- Reduce offshoot harvesting

### Winter
- Reduce watering significantly
- Place in brightest available location
- Keep away from cold drafts and heating vents
- No fertilizer

## Growth & Development

### Propagation
- **Methods**: Division of offsets (pups), stem cuttings
- **Best time**: Spring or summer
- **Time to root**: 2-3 weeks for offsets, 3-4 weeks for stem cuttings

### Repotting
- **Frequency**: Every 1-2 years
- **Best time**: Spring
- **Pot size**: Only 1-2 inches larger in diameter
- **Signs needed**: Roots growing through drainage holes, declining growth, root-bound

### Pruning
- **Purpose**: Remove damaged leaves, control appearance
- **Method**: Cut stems at base with clean scissors
- **Best time**: Any time as needed

## Common Issues

### Pests
- **Spider mites**: Fine webbing, stippled leaves
- **Mealybugs**: White cotton-like masses
- **Aphids**: Small insects on new growth

### Diseases
- **Root rot**: Yellowing leaves, soft stems
- **Powdery mildew**: White powdery coating on leaves
- **Leaf spot**: Brown spots with yellow halos

### Troubleshooting
- **Curling leaves**: Normal (slight curling) or stress from temperature/humidity changes
- **Pale leaves**: Too much light or nutrient deficiency
- **Leggy stem**: Insufficient light
- **Yellowing lower leaves**: Natural aging or overwatering

## Notes
- Non-toxic to pets and humans
- Produces numerous offsets/pups around the base and sometimes from stems
- Known as the "Friendship Plant" because it's easy to propagate and share
- Relatively new to Western cultivation (gained popularity after 2010)
- Distinctive circular leaves on thin petioles
- Leaves naturally orient toward light source
- Will rotate leaves to face light, giving "prayer plant" movement qualities
- Considered a good luck plant in some cultures
- Compact size makes it perfect for small spaces
- Unique pancake-shaped leaves make it a favorite for modern minimalist decor
- Originally brought to Norway by a Norwegian missionary in 1946
