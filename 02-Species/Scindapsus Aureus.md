# POTHOS (SCINDAPSUS AUREUS)
![[Scindapsus-Aureus.jpg]]
## Care Requirements

### Light
- **Ideal**: Medium to bright indirect light
- **Tolerates**: Low light, fluorescent lighting
- **Avoid**: Direct sunlight
- **Signs of too much light**: Scorched, yellow leaves
- **Signs of too little light**: Smaller leaves, less variegation, leggy growth

### Water
- **Frequency**: Every 7-14 days, when top 1-2 inches of soil are dry
- **Method**: Water thoroughly until it drains from bottom
- **Winter adjustment**: Reduce to every 2-3 weeks
- **Signs of overwatering**: Yellow leaves, black stems, root rot
- **Signs of underwatering**: Drooping, curling leaves, brown leaf edges

### Soil
- **Composition**: Well-draining potting mix with perlite (pH 6.1-6.5)

### Temperature
- **Ideal**: 65-85°F (18-29°C)
- **Minimum**: 50°F (10°C)
- **Avoid**: Temperatures below 45°F (7°C) and cold drafts

### Humidity
- **Ideal**: 40-60%
- **Minimum**: 20%
- **Enhancement methods**: Not necessary (tolerates dry air very well)

### Fertilizer
- **Growing season**: Balanced houseplant fertilizer at half strength, every 4-6 weeks
- **Winter**: No fertilizer needed
- **Signs of over-fertilization**: Brown leaf tips, stunted growth

## Seasonal Care

### Spring
- Resume regular watering schedule
- Begin fertilizing
- Prune leggy growth
- Propagate cuttings

### Summer
- Monitor soil moisture more frequently
- May need more water during hot periods
- Wipe leaves occasionally to remove dust
- Good time for propagation

### Fall
- Gradually reduce watering frequency
- Stop fertilizing
- Bring outdoors plants inside before temperatures drop

### Winter
- Reduce watering significantly
- Place in brightest available location
- Keep away from drafts and heating vents
- No fertilizer

## Growth & Development

### Propagation
- **Methods**: Stem cuttings in water or soil
- **Best time**: Spring or summer
- **Time to root**: 1-3 weeks in water, 3-4 weeks in soil

### Repotting
- **Frequency**: Every 1-2 years
- **Best time**: Spring
- **Pot size**: 1-2 inches larger in diameter
- **Signs needed**: Roots circling pot or growing through drainage holes, soil drying out too quickly

### Pruning
- **Purpose**: Control length, encourage bushier growth, remove damaged leaves
- **Method**: Cut stems with clean scissors just below a node
- **Best time**: Spring or summer

## Common Issues

### Pests
- **Mealybugs**: White cotton-like masses
- **Spider mites**: Fine webbing, stippled leaves
- **Scale**: Brown bumps on stems and leaves

### Diseases
- **Root rot**: Soft, black stems, yellowing leaves
- **Bacterial leaf spot**: Water-soaked spots, yellowing
- **Southern blight**: White fungal growth at soil level

### Troubleshooting
- **Leggy, sparse growth**: Insufficient light
- **Loss of variegation**: Too little light
- **Brown edges on leaves**: Low humidity or underwatering
- **Yellowing leaves**: Overwatering or root issues

## Notes
- Toxic to pets and humans if ingested
- Excellent air purifier - removes formaldehyde, xylene, and benzene
- Can grow to 30+ feet in natural habitat
- Several varieties: Golden Pothos, Marble Queen, Neon, Jade, N'Joy, Pearls and Jade
- Very resilient - often called "impossible to kill"
- Can be grown in water indefinitely
