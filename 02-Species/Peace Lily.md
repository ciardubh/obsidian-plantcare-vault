- **Method**: Water thoroughly until it drains from bottom
- **Winter adjustment**: Reduce to every 10-14 days
- **Signs of overwatering**: Yellowing leaves, root rot
- **Signs of underwatering**: Dramatic drooping (will recover quickly after watering)

### Soil
- **Composition**: Rich, well-draining potting mix with peat moss (pH 5.8-6.5)

### Temperature
- **Ideal**: 65-85°F (18-29°C)

- **Enhancement methods**: Pebble tray, humidifier, grouping plants, misting

### Fertilizer
- **Growing season**: Balanced liquid fertilizer at half strength, every 6-8 weeks
- **Winter**: No fertilizer needed
- **Signs of over-fertilization**: Brown leaf tips, stunted growth

## Seasonal Care

### Spring
- Resume regular watering schedule
- Begin fertilizing
- Repot if necessary
- Ideal time for division

### Summer
- Monitor soil moisture more frequently
- Maintain good humidity
- Protect from hot direct sun
- May need more frequent watering

### Fall
- Gradually reduce watering frequency
- Stop fertilizing
- Clean dust from leaves

### Winter
- Reduce watering significantly
- Place in brightest available location
- Keep away from cold drafts and heating vents
- No fertilizer

## Growth & Development

### Propagation
- **Methods**: Division of plant clumps during repotting
- **Best time**: Spring
- **Time to root**: 2-4 weeks for divisions to establish

### Repotting
- **Frequency**: Every 1-2 years
- **Best time**: Spring
- **Pot size**: 1-2 inches larger in diameter
- **Signs needed**: Crowded roots, poor drainage, stunted growth, frequent wilting

### Pruning
- **Purpose**: Remove spent flowers and yellowed leaves
- **Method**: Cut at base with clean scissors
- **Best time**: Any time as needed

## Common Issues

### Pests
- **Spider mites**: Fine webbing, stippled leaves
- **Mealybugs**: White cotton-like masses
- **Aphids**: Small insects on new growth and flowers

### Diseases
- **Root rot**: Yellowing leaves, soft stems, foul smell
- **Leaf spot**: Brown spots with yellow halos
- **Bacterial blight**: Water-soaked spots, wilting

### Troubleshooting
- **Brown leaf tips**: Low humidity, fluoride in water, or over-fertilization
- **Yellow leaves**: Overwatering or natural aging
- **No flowers**: Insufficient light or immature plant
- **Drooping leaves**: Underwatering (will recover quickly after watering)

## Notes
- Toxic to pets and humans if ingested
- One of the best air-purifying plants according to NASA
- The white "flower" is actually a modified leaf called a spathe, with the true flowers on the spadix
- Will communicate when it needs water by drooping dramatically
- Can flower throughout the year under proper conditions
- Popular varieties include 'Mauna Loa', 'Domino', and 'Sensation'
