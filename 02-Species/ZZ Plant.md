# ZZ PLANT

## Care Requirements

### Light
- **Ideal**: Medium indirect light
- **Tolerates**: Low light, fluorescent lighting, deep shade
- **Avoid**: Direct sunlight for extended periods
- **Signs of too much light**: Yellowing leaves, brown spots
- **Signs of too little light**: Leggy growth (but very tolerant of low light)

### Water
- **Frequency**: Every 2-4 weeks, when soil is completely dry
- **Method**: Water sparingly but thoroughly
- **Winter adjustment**: Reduce to once monthly or less
- **Signs of overwatering**: Yellowing leaves, soft stems, root rot
- **Signs of underwatering**: Slight wrinkling of leaves (extremely drought tolerant)

### Soil
- **Composition**: Well-draining potting mix with perlite or sand (pH 6.0-7.0)

### Temperature
- **Ideal**: 65-85°F (18-29°C)
- **Minimum**: 45°F (7°C)
- **Avoid**: Temperatures below 40°F (4°C) and cold drafts

### Humidity
- **Ideal**: 40-50%
- **Minimum**: 20%
- **Enhancement methods**: Not necessary (tolerates dry air very well)

### Fertilizer
- **Growing season**: Balanced liquid fertilizer at quarter strength, every 2-3 months
- **Winter**: No fertilizer needed
- **Signs of over-fertilization**: Brown leaf tips, salt buildup on soil

## Seasonal Care

### Spring
- Resume occasional watering
- Apply light fertilizer
- Look for new growth
- Repot if necessary

### Summer
- Monitor soil dryness (may need slightly more frequent watering)
- Protect from hot afternoon sun
- Wipe leaves to remove dust

### Fall
- Reduce watering frequency
- Stop fertilizing
- Prepare for slower winter growth

### Winter
- Minimal watering (once a month or less)
- Keep away from cold drafts and heating vents
- No fertilizer

## Growth & Development

### Propagation
- **Methods**: Leaf cuttings, division of rhizomes
- **Best time**: Spring or summer
- **Time to root**: 2-3 months for leaves to develop rhizomes, immediate for divisions

### Repotting
- **Frequency**: Every 2-3 years
- **Best time**: Spring
- **Pot size**: Only slightly larger (prefers to be somewhat pot-bound)
- **Signs needed**: Roots breaking pot, extremely crowded, poor drainage

### Pruning
- **Purpose**: Remove damaged or yellowed leaves
- **Method**: Cut leaves at base with clean, sharp scissors
- **Best time**: Any time as needed

## Common Issues

### Pests
- **Mealybugs**: White cotton-like masses
- **Scale insects**: Small brown bumps on stems and leaves
- **Spider mites**: Fine webbing, stippled leaves (rare)

### Diseases
- **Root rot**: Soft, yellow leaves, black stems
- **Leaf spot**: Brown spots with yellow halos (uncommon)

### Troubleshooting
- **Yellowing leaves**: Overwatering (most common issue)
- **Brown leaf tips**: Over-fertilization or extremely dry air
- **Stunted growth**: Normal (slow-growing plant) or pot-bound
- **Falling leaves**: Overwatering or cold damage

## Notes
- Toxic to pets and humans if ingested
- Extremely drought-tolerant due to water-storing rhizomes
- One of the most low-maintenance houseplants available
- Air-purifying properties
- Glossy, waxy leaves naturally repel dust and pests
- Very slow-growing plant
- Name "ZZ" comes from its scientific name, Zamioculcas zamiifolia
- Newer varieties include 'Raven' (black foliage) and 'Zenzi' (compact growth)
- Can survive in offices with only fluorescent lighting
- Often mistaken for artificial plants due to their perfect appearance
- Can go several weeks without water when established
