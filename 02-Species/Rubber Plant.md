# RUBBER PLANT
![[rubber-plant.jpg]]

## Care Requirements

### Light
- **Ideal**: Bright indirect light
- **Tolerates**: Medium light, morning direct sun
- **Avoid**: Direct afternoon sun, low light for extended periods
- **Signs of too much light**: Bleached, burned leaves
- **Signs of too little light**: Leggy growth, small leaves, leaf drop

### Water
- **Frequency**: Every 7-10 days, when top 1-2 inches of soil are dry
- **Method**: Water thoroughly until it drains from bottom
- **Winter adjustment**: Reduce to every 10-14 days
- **Signs of overwatering**: Yellowing leaves, leaf drop, root rot
- **Signs of underwatering**: Drooping, curling leaves, brown edges

### Soil
- **Composition**: Well-draining potting mix with perlite (pH 6.0-7.0)

### Temperature
- **Ideal**: 65-85°F (18-29°C)
- **Minimum**: 55°F (13°C)
- **Avoid**: Temperatures below 50°F (10°C) and cold drafts

### Humidity
- **Ideal**: 40-60%
- **Minimum**: 30%
- **Enhancement methods**: Pebble tray, humidifier, occasional misting

### Fertilizer
- **Growing season**: Balanced liquid fertilizer at half strength, monthly
- **Winter**: No fertilizer needed
- **Signs of over-fertilization**: Brown leaf edges, salt buildup on soil

## Seasonal Care

### Spring
- Resume regular watering schedule
- Begin fertilizing
- Wipe leaves to remove dust
- Ideal time for repotting and pruning

### Summer
- Maintain consistent watering
- Rotate plant for even growth
- Shield from intense afternoon sun
- Monitor for pest activity

### Fall
- Gradually reduce watering frequency
- Stop fertilizing
- Prepare for slower winter growth

### Winter
- Reduce watering significantly
- Place in brightest available location
- Keep away from cold drafts and heating vents
- No fertilizer

## Growth & Development

### Propagation
- **Methods**: Stem cuttings, air layering
- **Best time**: Spring or early summer
- **Time to root**: 3-6 weeks for cuttings

### Repotting
- **Frequency**: Every 1-2 years for young plants, every 2-3 years for mature plants
- **Best time**: Spring
- **Pot size**: 1-2 inches larger in diameter
- **Signs needed**: Roots circling pot or growing through drainage holes, slowed growth

### Pruning
- **Purpose**: Control height and shape, encourage branching
- **Method**: Use clean, sharp pruners, wearing gloves to avoid sap irritation
- **Best time**: Spring or early summer

## Common Issues

### Pests
- **Spider mites**: Fine webbing, stippled leaves
- **Scale insects**: Brown bumps on stems and leaves
- **Mealybugs**: White cotton-like masses

### Diseases
- **Root rot**: Yellowing leaves, soft stems
- **Leaf spot**: Brown spots with yellow halos
- **Anthracnose**: Black lesions on leaves

### Troubleshooting
- **Leaf drop**: Changes in environment, overwatering, underwatering
- **Yellow leaves**: Overwatering or natural aging of lower leaves
- **Brown edges**: Underwatering, low humidity
- **Leggy growth**: Insufficient light

## Notes
- Toxic to pets and humans if ingested
- Produces milky latex sap (can cause skin irritation)
- Air-purifying plant that removes formaldehyde
- Can grow to ceiling height indoors with proper care
- Common varieties include:
  - 'Burgundy' (deep reddish-purple leaves)
  - 'Tineke' (variegated cream and green)
  - 'Ruby' (variegated pink and green)
  - 'Robusta' (large, dark green leaves)
- Does not typically flower or fruit indoors
- Can be pruned to maintain desired size and encourage branching
- The plant is called "rubber plant" due to its latex sap once used in rubber production
- Juvenile leaves may differ in color and texture from mature leaves
- Leaves should be wiped regularly to maintain glossiness and health
