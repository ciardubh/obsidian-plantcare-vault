# STRING OF HEARTS
![[string-of-hearts.jpg]]

## Care Requirements

### Light
- **Ideal**: Bright indirect light with some direct morning sun
- **Tolerates**: Partial shade
- **Avoid**: Intense afternoon direct sunlight, deep shade
- **Signs of too much light**: Bleaching, discoloration of leaves
- **Signs of too little light**: Increased spacing between leaves, loss of variegation, thin stems

### Water
- **Frequency**: Every 10-14 days, when soil is completely dry
- **Method**: Thorough soaking, allowing excess to drain
- **Winter adjustment**: Reduce to every 3-4 weeks
- **Signs of overwatering**: Yellowing leaves, rotting stems, mushy tubers
- **Signs of underwatering**: Shriveled, thin leaves, dry stems

### Soil
- **Composition**: Well-draining succulent mix with added sand or perlite (pH 6.0-7.0)

### Temperature
- **Ideal**: 65-85°F (18-29°C)
- **Minimum**: 50°F (10°C)
- **Avoid**: Temperatures below 40°F (4°C) and cold drafts

### Humidity
- **Ideal**: 40-60%
- **Minimum**: 30%
- **Enhancement methods**: Not crucial (tolerates average home humidity)

### Fertilizer
- **Growing season**: Diluted houseplant fertilizer at 1/4 strength, monthly
- **Winter**: No fertilizer needed
- **Signs of over-fertilization**: Brown leaf edges, stunted growth

## Seasonal Care

### Spring
- Resume regular watering schedule
- Begin light fertilization
- Look for aerial tubers for propagation
- Ideal time for repotting

### Summer
- Monitor soil moisture more frequently
- Protect from intense afternoon sun
- Check for pests regularly
- Enjoy rapid growth period

### Fall
- Gradually reduce watering frequency
- Stop fertilizing
- Prepare for semi-dormancy

### Winter
- Minimal watering (only when leaves show slight wrinkling)
- Place in brightest available location
- Keep away from cold drafts and heating vents
- No fertilizer

## Growth & Development

### Propagation
- **Methods**: Stem cuttings, aerial tubers, butterfly method (single leaf with node)
- **Best time**: Spring or summer
- **Time to root**: 2-3 weeks for stem cuttings, 1-2 months for tubers to establish

### Repotting
- **Frequency**: Every 2-3 years
- **Best time**: Spring
- **Pot size**: Shallow pots preferred (4-6 inches wide)
- **Signs needed**: Crowded tubers, poor drainage, declining health

### Pruning
- **Purpose**: Control length, encourage bushier growth
- **Method**: Trim with clean scissors, propagate cuttings
- **Best time**: Spring or summer

## Common Issues

### Pests
- **Mealybugs**: White cotton-like masses in leaf axils
- **Spider mites**: Fine webbing, stippled leaves
- **Aphids**: Small insects on new growth

### Diseases
- **Root rot**: Soft stems at soil level, yellowing leaves
- **Powdery mildew**: White powdery coating on leaves
- **Leaf spot**: Brown spots with yellow halos

### Troubleshooting
- **Leaves falling off**: Overwatering or extreme temperature changes
- **Strings with no leaves**: Insufficient light or age
- **Faded variegation**: Too little light
- **Thin, stretched stems**: Light deficiency

## Notes
- Non-toxic to pets and humans
- Forms potato-like tubers both underground and along stems
- Pink/purple tiny flowers shaped like lanterns
- Variegated forms available ('Variegata,' 'Silver Glory')
- Can trail up to 12+ feet in ideal conditions
- Sometimes called "Rosary Vine" or "Sweetheart Vine"
