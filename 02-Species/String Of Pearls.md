# STRING OF PEARLS
![[string-of-pearls.jpg]]

## Care Requirements

### Light
- **Ideal**: Bright indirect light
- **Tolerates**: Some morning direct sun
- **Avoid**: Intense direct afternoon sunlight
- **Signs of too much light**: Shriveled pearls, brown spots
- **Signs of too little light**: Stretched out spacing between pearls, small bead size

### Water
- **Frequency**: Every 2-3 weeks, when soil is completely dry
- **Method**: Soak-and-dry, watering thoroughly until it drains
- **Winter adjustment**: Reduce to once monthly
- **Signs of overwatering**: Mushy, burst pearls, stem rot
- **Signs of underwatering**: Shriveled, puckered pearls, dry stems

### Soil
- **Composition**: Fast-draining succulent/cactus mix with extra perlite (pH 6.0-7.5)

### Temperature
- **Ideal**: 70-80°F (21-27°C)
- **Minimum**: 50°F (10°C)
- **Avoid**: Temperatures below 40°F (4°C) and cold drafts

### Humidity
- **Ideal**: 40-50%
- **Minimum**: 30%
- **Enhancement methods**: Not needed (tolerates dry air)

### Fertilizer
- **Growing season**: Diluted succulent fertilizer at 1/4 strength, every 4-6 weeks
- **Winter**: No fertilizer needed
- **Signs of over-fertilization**: Salt build-up, burnt leaf tips

## Seasonal Care

### Spring
- Resume regular watering as growth accelerates
- Begin light fertilization
- Remove any dead strands
- Ideal time for propagation

### Summer
- Shield from intense direct sunlight
- Monitor watering needs (may increase slightly)
- Watch for pests, especially spider mites
- Provide good air circulation

### Fall
- Reduce watering frequency
- Stop fertilizing
- Begin preparing for dormancy

### Winter
- Minimal watering (once every 3-4 weeks)
- Place in brightest available location
- Keep away from cold drafts and heating sources
- No fertilizer

## Growth & Development

### Propagation
- **Methods**: Stem cuttings
- **Best time**: Spring or early summer
- **Time to root**: 2-4 weeks

### Repotting
- **Frequency**: Every 2 years
- **Best time**: Spring
- **Pot size**: Shallow, wide containers preferable to deep pots
- **Signs needed**: Overcrowded, declining health, poor drainage

### Pruning
- **Purpose**: Remove dead/damaged strands, shape, encourage fullness
- **Method**: Cut stems with clean scissors, save healthy cuttings for propagation
- **Best time**: Spring or early summer

## Common Issues

### Pests
- **Mealybugs**: White cotton-like masses
- **Spider mites**: Fine webbing, stippled appearance
- **Scale**: Small brown bumps on stems

### Diseases
- **Root rot**: Soft, black stems, foul odor
- **Powdery mildew**: White powdery coating on stems or pearls

### Troubleshooting
- **Shriveled pearls**: Under-watering or over-watering (check stem condition)
- **Pearls falling off**: Environmental stress, overwatering
- **Yellow strands**: Overwatering or age
- **Leggy growth**: Insufficient light

## Notes
- Toxic to pets and humans if ingested
- Fragrant small white flowers when happy
- Hanging plant, strings can grow 2-3 feet long
- Relatively short-lived (3-5 years) even with ideal care
- Commonly confused with String of Tears (Senecio herreianus), which has tear-shaped beads
