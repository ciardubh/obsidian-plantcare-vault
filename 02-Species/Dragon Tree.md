## Care Requirements

### Light
- **Ideal**: Bright indirect light
- **Tolerates**: Medium to low light, fluorescent lighting
- **Avoid**: Direct sunlight, especially in afternoon
- **Signs of too much light**: Bleached, scorched leaves
- **Signs of too little light**: Slow growth, smaller leaves, leaf drop

### Water
- **Frequency**: Every 10-14 days, when top 1-2 inches of soil are dry
- **Method**: Water thoroughly until it drains from bottom
- **Winter adjustment**: Reduce to every 3-4 weeks
- **Signs of overwatering**: Yellowing leaves, soft stems, root rot
- **Signs of underwatering**: Brown leaf tips, curling leaves

### Soil
- **Composition**: Well-draining potting mix with perlite (pH 6.0-7.0)

### Temperature
- **Ideal**: 65-80°F (18-27°C)
- **Minimum**: 55°F (13°C)
- **Avoid**: Temperatures below 50°F (10°C) and cold drafts

### Humidity
- **Ideal**: 40-50%
- **Minimum**: 30%
- **Enhancement methods**: Not necessary (tolerates dry air well)

### Fertilizer
- **Growing season**: Balanced liquid fertilizer at half strength, every 6-8 weeks
- **Winter**: No fertilizer needed
- **Signs of over-fertilization**: Brown leaf tips, salt buildup on soil

## Seasonal Care

### Spring
- Resume regular watering schedule
- Begin fertilizing
- Wipe leaves to remove dust
- Ideal time for repotting

### Summer
- Monitor soil moisture
- Provide consistent care
- Protect from hot, direct sun
- Watch for pest activity

### Fall
- Gradually reduce watering frequency
- Stop fertilizing
- Prepare for slower winter growth

### Winter
- Reduce watering significantly
- Place in brightest available location
- Keep away from cold drafts and heating vents
- No fertilizer

## Growth & Development

### Propagation
- **Methods**: Stem cuttings in soil or water, air layering for larger plants
- **Best time**: Spring or summer
- **Time to root**: 3-6 weeks for stem cuttings

### Repotting
- **Frequency**: Every 2-3 years
- **Best time**: Spring
- **Pot size**: Only 1-2 inches larger in diameter
- **Signs needed**: Roots circling pot or growing through drainage holes, top-heavy plant

### Pruning
- **Purpose**: Control height, remove damaged leaves, encourage branching
- **Method**: Cut stems with clean, sharp pruners
- **Best time**: Spring or early summer

## Common Issues

### Pests
- **Spider mites**: Fine webbing, stippled leaves
- **Scale insects**: Brown bumps on stems and leaves
- **Mealybugs**: White cotton-like masses

### Diseases
- **Root rot**: Yellowing leaves, soft stems
- **Leaf spot**: Brown spots with yellow halos
- **Fusarium leaf spot**: Yellow spots that turn reddish-brown

### Troubleshooting
- **Brown leaf tips**: Dry air, fluoride or chlorine in water, over-fertilization
- **Yellow leaves**: Overwatering or natural aging of lower leaves
- **Leaf drop**: Cold drafts, overwatering, shock
- **Pale leaves**: Too much direct light
